        <p>I'm a professional Web Developer. I've spent some years to understand and be able to create websites that look good and are understandable for browsers. I've started to learn this subject in my IT high school. Where for the first time I learnt sth about IT, it was also the first time when I saw how to built simple webpages and how to manage databasese or I lernt basis of others obejct languages like c++.
        I've finishe this high school and had some gap years from this terms and knowledge but than I decided to go back to it and so I study it and use it for a couple of years. My project and work, you can see on this site</p>
